                    After starting to make a living of my biggest hobby, there was the need
                    for a new one. Since have always been interested in documenting my life
                    and travels <em>and</em> being generally interested in technical things, 
                    choosing photography as a hobby was quite obvious.
                </p>

                    Bringing the technical 
                    (the camera and its settings) and non-technical elements (finding a 
                    composition) together brings me a lot of joy. If you're interested in my 
                    pictures have a look at my <a href="https://www.dertagundich.de">personal 
                    blog</a> where I post some of them from time to time.
