    <p>
        After starting to make a living of my biggest hobby, there was the need
        for a new one. Since have always been interested in documenting my life
        and travels <em>and</em> being generally interested in technical things, 
        choosing photography as a hobby was quite obvious.

        Bringing the technical (the camera and its settings) and non-technical 
        elements (finding a composition) together brings me a lot of joy. If 
        you're interested in my pictures have a look at my 
        <a href="https://www.dertagundich.de">personal blog</a> where I post 
        some of them from time to time. Sadly, I did not take much time lately 
        to go out and take some pictures.
