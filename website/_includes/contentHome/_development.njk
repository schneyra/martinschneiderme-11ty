    <p>I never thought of making a career as a webdeveloper when I startet to learn HTML in the summer of 1998. But never losing the fun building sites in my free time while studying made me confident that I should give it a try. So I ended up beeing a frontend developer with a degree in applied informatics. Since then, I've been working on backend applications for healthcare providers, europes biggest website for recipes, <a href="https://www.chefkoch.de">chefkoch.de</a>, as well as countless websites for all kinds of clients.</p>

    <p>Although I have always explored a lot of topics besides frontend development, learning about <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>, Microservices, Docker, <abbr title="Continous Integration">CI</abbr> and <abbr title="Continous Deployment">CD</abbr>, caching strategies or server administration was never as much fun as building websites with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript. Today I focus on building responsible, fast and accessible websites. I believe in the concept of <em>progressive enhancement</em> as basis of my work and try to use as little technology as possible. I'm trying to improve my skills every day.</p>
    
    <p>Apart from the actual work as a developer, I've been working as teamlead and spend quite some time organizing and simplifying processes within the development-team. That includes as well the cooperation between project management, design-teams and developers. I'm a big fan of Scrum and certified as <em>Professional Scrum Product Owner I</em>.</p>
