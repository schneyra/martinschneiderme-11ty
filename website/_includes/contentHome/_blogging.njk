        <h2 id="blogging">Blogging</h2>
        <p>I've been blogging for over 20 years now. The first posts in my german blog date back to february 2003. To challenge myself a bit more and to have an opportunity to work on my english skills I've started a second blog almost two years ago.</p>
        <h3>The technical stuff</h3>
        <p>You are currently on my personal website where I write about web development from time to time. These are my latest articles.</p>
        <ul class="article-list flow">
            {% set articles = collections.articles | reverse %}
            {%- for article in articles.slice(0,5) -%}
                <li class="article-list-article">
                    <h4 class="article-list-article__headline">
                        <a href="{{ article.url }}">{{ article.data.title }}</a>
                    </h4>
                </li>
            {%- endfor -%}
        </ul>

        <h3>The trivialities</h3>
        <p> I also have a german blog at
                    <a href="https://www.dertagundich.de">dertagundich.de</a> where I post more frequently about the trivialities of my life. There's content from over twenty years now, these are my most recent posts.</p>
        {% if dtuiposts.status === "ok" %}
            <ul class="article-list flow">
                {%- for article in dtuiposts.data -%}
                    <li class="article-list-article">
                        <h4 class="article-list-article__headline">
                            <a href="{{ article.url }}">{{ article.title }}</a>
                        </h4>
                    </li>
